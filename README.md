## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5174](http://localhost:5174).

Create a `.env.local` file with:

```env
VITE_PB_URL=https://your-pocketbase-instance.fly.dev
VITE_CARTO_KEY=your_carto_basemaps_key
CWA_API_KEY=your_cwa_api_key
```

## Deployment

The app deploys to Vercel. Set the following environment variables in your Vercel project:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `VITE_PB_URL` | PocketBase instance URL |
| `VITE_CARTO_KEY` | CARTO basemaps key for the "Clear" map ([request](https://carto.com/basemaps/apikey)) |
| `CWA_API_KEY` | Central Weather Administration API key ([register](https://opendata.cwa.gov.tw/)) |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Resend API key for email submissions ([register](https://resend.com/)) |

```bash
npm run build   # outputs to dist/
```

Push to GitHub — Vercel picks it up automatically.

## Public Route Submission API

`POST /api/routes/submit` accepts route suggestions for administrator review. A `202` response with `status: "pending_review"` means the suggestion was received; it does not create or publish a route directly.

```bash
curl -X POST https://tw-canyoning.vercel.app/api/routes/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Example Creek","region":"Nantou","grading":"V3 A3 III","gps":"23.9601,120.9719","contact_email":"user@example.com","note":"Access notes"}'
```

Required fields: `name`, `region`, `grading`, `gps`. Optional fields: `name_en`, `type`, `max_drop`, `approach`, `total_time`, `deep_pool`, `ab_shuttle`, `note`, and `contact_email`. Browser requests are supported through CORS.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
